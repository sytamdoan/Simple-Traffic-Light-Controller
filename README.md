# Simple-Traffic-Light-Controller

  This lab simulates a traffic light with 6 LEDS and 2 switches. The software design is done using an Finite State Machine to transition between the lights. This lab was done in
CECS 346. Overall a very simple lab that introduces the concept of Finite State Machine in C.
